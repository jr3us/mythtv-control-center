.SH "USAGE"
mythbuntu\-control\-centre [\-h|\-\-help] [\-\-debug] [\-\-plugin\-root\-path PATH] [\-l|\-\-logfile FILE]

\-h, \-\-help   Shows the application usage

\-\-debug       Frontend debug mode.  Useful for plugin development when plugins
                implement the logging class.
                NOTE: this does NOT start the backend in debug mode.  If you
                are doing plugin development, be sure to manually restart the
                backend between different runs.  The backend also loads plugins
                into memory so you may otherwise see inconsistencies.

\-\-plugin\-root\-path PATH Defines where to look for plugins.  The default system
                            path will be used if this directory is missing
                            python/ and glade/ or this directory isn't specified.

\-l FILE, \-\-logfile FILE  Specifies an alternative place to log output when
                            the frontend is being ran in debug mode.
